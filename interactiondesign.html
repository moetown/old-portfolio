			<h2>Iphone Control center</h2>
			<p>The project was carried out meanwhile studying Interaction design with the aim to improve
			a function of a daily used digital artefact. In this case, it was the usage of the Control Center which
			is a quick function for accessing applications that are especially used and that are safe
			enough to be used when the screen is locked. The idea was to make the applications replacable so
			that the user can easily add their favorites to the Control Center application field through
			simple means. The user simply drag and drop the application in place over an existing app. The apps
			can also be modified in "Settings" under the Control Center section. Sketch was used for the
			vectorbased designs.</p>
