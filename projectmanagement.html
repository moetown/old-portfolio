			<h2>Volvo Cars</h2>
			<p>My employment as Group Design Leader for Volvo Cars was higly communicative and design driven.
			I was assigned for a project leader role with design responsibility in three different exterior design
			car projects. These were projects proceeding in different parts of the product development phase aiming
			for a future global market. My specific area was exterior trim and roofing. The role was highly interactive
			between design, construction, suppliers, assembly, technical prerequisites and production. I worked on the
			project from April 2016-December 2016. I decided to have a leave from my employment to continue to study
			Webb development and Interaction Design. </p>
