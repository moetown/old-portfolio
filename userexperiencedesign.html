			<h2>Ericsson and Semcon</h2>
			<p>The project concerned how to improve the remote collaboration context and the experience of a remote meeting at Ericsson.
			The aim was to aid users to collaborate more, as the climate in this large company environment combined
			with technical equipment and available digital tools were hindering the more creative and spontanious environments on remote.
			The dynamics between participants, some being more dominant and some being more passive, were found to widely affect the outcome and
			quality of the meeting. We questioned oureselves: how can a user feel inclued and "there" when being thousands of miles
			away from the person(s) they are having a conversation with? How could we include the users more in the digital meeting room?

			<p> The project resulted in a software prototype which aims to adress these topics and provide a solution. It aids the users through
			encouraging more individual participation: both in the physical meeting room evironment and on a distance. This is achieved through
			integrating interactive components to increase expressability, such as opinionated buttons and icons to be able to call for attention.
			Furthermore did the software transcribe speech to text in order to remove the need of a secretary. A role which often is separated from
			the collaborative space. The software also simplified how to start a meeting as it is a browserbased direct link to the meeting room
			rather than a program that needs to be installed.

			<p>Contextual inqury, interviews, observational studies and mock-up user testing were a few of the methods used. Adobe Creative suite (Photoshop,
			Illustrator, Indesign) were used for the concepting and presentation material. The project was carried through
			 from September 2015 to February 2016.
